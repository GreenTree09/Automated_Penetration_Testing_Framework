# Automated Penetration Testing Framework

## 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: The objective of this project is to develop an automated penetration testing framework for Linux systems. This framework aims to streamline the process of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities by automating network scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting.
- **Background**: Penetration testing is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, allowing organizations to proactively identify and address potential security threats. By combining the strengths of C++, Python, and Bash, the framework will provide high performance, ease of development, and automation.

## 2. Requirements Analysis
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Network scanning to discover devices and services (C++).
  - Vulnerability assessment to identify known vulnerabilities (Python).
  - Exploitation to verify the existence of vulnerabilities (C++).
  - Reporting to generate detailed reports of findings (Python).
  - User interface for configuring and running tests.
  - Automation scripts for setup, testing, and deployment (Bash).
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Performance: The framework should efficiently handle large networks.
  - Security: The framework must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data.
  - Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.

## 3. System Design
- **Architecture**: The framework will consist of several interconnected modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the penetration testing process. The main components include the network scanning module (C++), vulnerability assessment module (Python), exploitation module (C++), reporting module (Python), and automation scripts (Bash).

    - **Directory**: `src/vulnerability_assessment/`
    - **Files**: `assessor.py`
  - **Exploitation Module**: Implements performance-critical exploitation tasks in C++.
    - **Directory**: `src/exploitation/`
    - **Files**: `exploiter.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`
  - **Reporting Module**: Generates reports using Python for ease of development and rich library support.
    - **Directory**: `src/reporting/`
    - **Files**: `reporter.py`
  - **Main Application**: Uses C++ for the main application logic to ensure high performance.
    - **Directory**: `src/`
    - **Files**: `main.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`
  - **Automation Scripts**: Uses Bash for setup, testing, and deployment automation.
    - **Directory**: `scripts/`
    - **Files**: `setup.sh`, `run_tests.sh`, `deploy.sh`

## 4. Implementation
- **Development Environment**: Set up the development environment, including necessary tools and libraries such as CMake, libpcap, Python, and relevant Python libraries.
- **Coding**: Implement each module, ensuring they work together seamlessly. Focus on modularity and code reusability.
- **Testing**: Perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure the framework functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.

## 5. User Interface Design
- **CLI/GUI**: Decide whether to implement a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) based on user needs.
- **User Experience**: Design the interface to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and feedback for the user.

## 6. Deployment
- **Installation**: Provide detailed instructions for installing and configuring the framework on various Linux distributions.
- **Usage**: Create a comprehensive user manual or guide to help users get started with the framework, including examples and best practices.

## 7. Future Development
